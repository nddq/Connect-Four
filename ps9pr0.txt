For me, I think that I would not use this tool as all, because of how it would monitors closely my activities on the browser and how I generally interact with the internet. For example, if I want to return to a certain website in the future, I would just bookmarked it. The risk of having a tool that linked your browsing history is too high, as it could lead to many potential problems. For example, if the tool's vulnerability is exploited then my data will be exposed to unwanted hands, or the tool could be used to send back the data to the developer themselve, which violated my privacy.
